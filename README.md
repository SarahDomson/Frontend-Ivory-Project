## Project Overview
This project is a responsive recreation of a Figma design, implemented with Tailwind CSS. The goal is to faithfully replicate the design and ensure it adapts smoothly across devices and screen sizes. This project highlights my skills in frontend development, particularly in CSS frameworks and responsive design.

## Features
- Pixel-perfect recreation of the Figma design
- Fully responsive layout across all screen sizes
- Interactive and accessible elements
- Clean and maintainable code structure

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the project
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: For added interactivity (if applicable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor and use a live server to view changes instantly.

## Usage
- Open `index.html` to view the landing page.
- Navigate through the project structure to explore various sections recreated from the Figma design.

## Responsive Design
This project is designed to be fully responsive, meaning it will adapt to different screen sizes, including:
- **Mobile Devices**: Small screens with optimized layouts
- **Tablets**: Adjusted layout for medium screens
- **Desktop**: Full-sized layout for larger screens

Responsive breakpoints were implemented to ensure a consistent user experience across devices.

## Project Status
This project is currently complete with room for additional optimizations or feature enhancements.
